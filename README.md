Paint Online for group drawing.
After the user logs in, a room is created the link, user can send it to his friends and draw together. 
All users can draw at the same time without interfering with each other on the same canvas, they can also cancel or redo actions, and move drawn figures or simply brush strokes.
All this happens smoothly (if you have normal Internet) and without interfering with each other.
Visually it may seem like a simple project, but its functionality is very good. During development, I used react, redux, websockets, git for version control and uploading the project to the cloud (aws ec2).

(the project is temporarily unavailable due to the expiration of free access to aws ec2)
